      **(Optional) Verifiy using the latest release of WSL/WSLg**:
      
      It is always good idea to verify the issue is still reproducible on the latest WSL/WSLg release whenever possible. WSL/WSLg can be updated from https://aka.ms/wslstorepage, or when Microsoft Store is not accessible from your environment, by downloading the latest release package (.msixbundle) from https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases.
